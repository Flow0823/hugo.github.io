# **Abstract**
**Background:** Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent and potentially devastating chronic illness affecting many older adults. Given spousal involvement in many aspects of diabetes management, coping with their partners is increasingly seen as a potential solution to make up for limited resources. This study aimed to identify the key conditions for optimal implementation of couple-based collaborative management model (CCMM) among Chinese older couples with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Methods:** Older couples and community healthcare practitioners were selected according to couples' joint intervention attendance rate and community's average attendance rate. This mixed methods research consisted of a qualitative phase and a quantitative phase. In the qualitative phase, in-depth interviews were conducted among 12 pairs of couples in the intervention group and 4 corresponding practitioners, in the follow-up period of the multicentered RCT from January to April 2022. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) in the quantitative phase to identify conditions influencing CCMM's implementation and to explore necessary and sufficient combinations of conditions (i.e., solutions) for improving patients' glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control (outcome).

**Results:** Key conditions included implementation process, couple's role in diabetes management, their belief and perception of CCMM, as well as objective obstacles and subjective initiative for behavior change. Accordingly, major barriers in CCMM's implementation were patients' strong autonomy (particularly among husbands), misbelief and misperception about diabetes management as a result of low literacy, and mistrust of the practitioners. QCA further revealed that no single condition was necessary for effective HbA1c control, while three types of their combinations would be sufficient. Solution 1 and 2 both comprised the presence of spousal willingness to help, plus correct belief and perception of diabetes management, well embodying the utility of couple collaborative management in supporting patients' HbA1c control. On the other hand, solution 3 indicated that high-quality implementation even without spousal support, can promote the patient's subjective initiative to overcome objective obstacles, suggesting enhanced self-management for HbA1c control.

**Conclusions:** Tailored CCMM should be implemented in reference to older couple's preferences and literacy levels, to ensure intervention fidelity, and establish correct understanding of collaborative management among them.
