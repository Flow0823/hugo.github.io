# **Abstract**
**Background:** China's limited health care resources cannot meet the needs of chronic disease treatment and management of its rapid growing ageing population. The improvement and maintenance of patient's self-management is essential to disease management. Given disease management mainly occurs in the context of family, this study proposes to validate a Couple-based Collaborative Management Model of chronic diseases that integrates health professionals and family supporters; such as to empower the couples with disease management knowledge and skills, and to improve the couples' health and quality of life.

**Methods:** The proposed study will validate a couple-based collaborative management model of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in a community-based multicenter, two-arm, randomized controlled trial of block design in Guangzhou, China. Specifically, 194 T2DM patients aged ≥55 and their partners recruited from community health care centers will be randomized at the patient level for each center at a 1:1 ratio into the couple-based intervention arm and the individual-based control arm. For the intervention arm, both the patients and their spouses will receive four-weekly structured group education & training sessions and 2 months of weekly tailored behavior change boosters; while these interventions will be only provided to the patients in the control group. Behavior change incentives will be targeted at the couples or only at the patient respectively. Treatment effects on patients' hemoglobin, spouses' quality of life, alongside couples' behavior outcomes will be compared between arms. Study implementation will be evaluated considering its Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance following the RE-AIM framework.

**Discussion:** This study will generate a model of effective collaboration between community health professionals and patients' family, which will shield light on chronic disease management strategy for the increasing ageing population.
