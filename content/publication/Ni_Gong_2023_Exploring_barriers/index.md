# **Abstract**
**Background:** Dementia has become a global public health problem, and general practitioners (GPs) play a key role in diagnosing and managing dementia. However, in Chinese primary care settings, dementia is underdiagnosed and inefficiently managed, and dementia screening and management services provided by GPs are suboptimal. The reasons underlying this gap are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the barriers that hinder GPs from actively promoting dementia screening and management, and thereby provide insights for the successful promotion of dementia screening and management services in primary care.

**Methods:** Purposive sampling was used. And focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face among GPs from community health service centers (CHSCs) in South China. Thematic analysis was used to identify barriers to screening and managing dementia and map them to the Capability/Opportunity/Motivation-Behavior model (COM-B model).

**Results:** Fifty-two GPs were included. The COM-B model found nine barriers to implementing dementia screening and management services in primary healthcare: (1) poor capability: lack of systematic knowledge of dementia and inadequate dementia screening skills; (2) little opportunity: unclear pathways for referral, insufficient time for dementia screening and management, lack of dementia-specific leaders, and no guarantee of services continuity; (3) low motivation: outside of GP scope, worries associated with dementia stigma rooted in culture beliefs, and insufficient financial incentives.

**Conclusions:** Our study concluded that GPs were not yet ready to provide dementia screening and management services due to poor capability related to knowledge and skills of dementia, little opportunity associated with an unsupportive working environment, and low motivation due to unclear duty and social pressure. Accordingly, systematic implementation strategies should be taken, including standardized dementia training programs, standardized community-based dementia guidelines, expansion of primary care workforces, development of dedicated leaders, and the eradication of stigma attached to dementia to promote dementia screening and management services in primary care.
