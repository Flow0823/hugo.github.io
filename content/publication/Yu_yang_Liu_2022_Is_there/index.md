# **Abstract**
**Introduction:** It is valuable to identify common latent cognitive constructs for dementia prevalence estimation across Chinese aging cohorts.

**Methods:** Based on cognitive measures of 12015 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS; 13 items) and 6623 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS; 9 items) participants aged 65 to 99 in 2018, confirmatory factor analysis was applied to identify latent cognitive constructs, and to estimate dementia prevalence compared to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and nationwide estimates of the literature.

**Results:** A common three-factor cognitive construct of orientation, memory, and executive function and language was found for both cohorts with adequate model fits. Crude dementia prevalence estimated by factor scores was similar to MMSE in CLHLS, and was more reliable in CHARLS. Age-standardized dementia estimates of CLHLS were lower than CHARLS among those aged 70+, which were close to the nationwide prevalence reported by the COAST study and Global Burden of Disease.

**Discussion:** We verified common three-factor cognitive constructs for both cohorts, providing an approach to estimate dementia prevalence at the national level.

**Highlights:** Common three-factor cognitive constructs were identified in Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).Crude dementia estimates using factor scores were reliable in both cohorts.Estimates of CHARLS were close to current evidence, but higher than that of CLHLS.
