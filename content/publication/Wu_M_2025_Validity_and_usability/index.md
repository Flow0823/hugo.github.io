# summary: Background: The practicality of implementing digital cognitive screening tests in primary health care (PHC) for the detection of cognitive impairments, particularly among populations with lower education levels, remains unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the validity and usability of digital cognitive screening tests in PHC settings. Methods: We utilized a randomized crossover design, whereby 47 community-dwelling participants aged 65 and above were randomized into two groups. One group completed the paper-based Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Test (CDT) first, followed by the tablet-based digital version after a two-week washout period, while the other group did the reverse. Validity was assessed by Spearman correlation, linear mixed-effects models, sensitivity specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). Usability was assessed through the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) questionnaire, participant preferences and assessment duration. Regression analyses were conducted to explore the impact of usability on digital test scores, controlling for cognitive level, education, age, and gender. Results: Regarding validity, digital tests showed moderate correlations with paper-based versions and superior AUC performance. The AUC was 0.65 for the MMSE versus 0.82 for the electronic MMSE (eMMSE), and 0.45 for the CDT compared to 0.65 for the electronic CDT (eCDT). Regarding usability, while older participants gave positive feedback on digital tests (P < 0.001), they preferred paper-based versions. The eMMSE took significantly longer to complete than the MMSE, averaging 7.11 min versus 6.21 min (P = 0.01). Notably, digital test scores were minimally affected by subjective attitudes but strongly linked to test duration (β = -0.62, 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.17). Conclusions: Digital cognitive tests are valid and feasible in PHC settings but face implementation challenges, especially in usability and adaptability among individuals with lower education levels.

# **Abstract**
**Importance**: Spousal involvement in diabetes care is recommended theoretically, but effectiveness in clinical settings and among diverse populations is unclear.

**Objective**: To test the effect of a couple-based intervention among Chinese older patients with type 2 diabetes and their spouses.

**Design, setting, and participants**: This multicenter randomized clinical trial comprised 2 arms: a couple-based intervention arm and an individual-based control. The trial was conducted across 14 community health care centers in Guangzhou, China, between September 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, and included patients with confirmed type 2 diabetes aged 55 years or older. Eligible partners were married to or cohabitated with the patients. Patients who previously participated in type 2 diabetes education courses were excluded, as were couples who both had diabetes, to make a clear distinction between patients and spouses. The data were analyzed between January 2023 and April 2024.

**Interventions**: The interventions consisted of 4 weekly group education sessions followed by behavior change booster telephone calls over 2 months that targeted either patients and spouses (ie, intervention arm) or patients alone (ie, control arm). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months post intervention.

**Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels for patients and quality of life for their spouses. Collective efficacy and behaviors were secondary outcomes for both patients and spouses. Group comparisons were conducted using multilevel models based on an intention-to-treat approach, with outcome measures assessed for both patients and their spouses.

**Results**: A total of 207 couples were included in the study, with 106 randomized to the intervention arm and 101 to the control arm. The mean (SD) age of patients was 66.0 (6.5) years, with 105 (50.7%) being men; spouses had similar demographics. Patients' HbA1c levels decreased in both arms over the 12-month follow-up, with no significant between-arm differences (β = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.57 to 0.42). Collective efficacy and collective behavior for patients increased after intervention but with a similar magnitude between arms. None of these measures showed between-arm differences among spouses in either arm. In subgroup analysis, decreases in HbA1c levels were constant and lasting in patients with high baseline HbA1c levels (≥8.0%) with a statistically significant difference.

**Conclusions and relevance**: These findings show that the overall treatment effect of the couple-based intervention was weak. However, the couple-based intervention benefited patients with poor glucose control. Patients' glucose levels, spouses' availability to provide support, and couples' collaborative preferences for mutual or individual diabetes management should be considered in tailoring treatment strategies among older adults with type 2 diabetes.
