# **Abstract**
**Background and objectives:** There is a growing demand for dementia care to be funded by long-term care insurance (LTCI). However, evidence indicates that people with dementia are overlooked in China's LTCI policy and empirical research on this issue is notably scarce. Among the first seven LTCI pilot cities that officially enrolled people with dementia, Guangzhou is unique for roll-back LTCI policies related to eligibility criteria and benefits. This study aims to explore why people with dementia are overlooked in China's LTCI policy, using Guangzhou as a case study.

**Methods:** Semi-structured interviews were conducted with stakeholders involved in LTCI need assessment and care delivery in Guangzhou. Eight LTCI assessment specialists, 22 formal caregivers, and six informal caregivers were interviewed from December 2021 to October 2022. Data was analyzed using NVivo 11.0 software and the Gilbert welfare framework to identify themes.

**Results:** Interviewees reported that need assessment lacked a clear definition, were poorly supervised, and had high moral hazards. Challenges to care delivery included unprofessionalism of formal caregivers, shortage of resources, unprepared informal caregivers, a lack of a supportive environment and the negative impact of COVID-19. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: People with dementia are overlooked in LTCI policy which may result from difficulties in implementing dementia-related assessment criteria, and hampered service delivery due to a shortage of skilled caregivers. These issues need to be carefully considered before scaling up the coverage of LTCI policy nationwide.
