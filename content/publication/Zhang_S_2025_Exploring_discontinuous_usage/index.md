# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Background: Digital cognitive training (DCT) has been found to be more effective than traditional paper-and-pencil training in enhancing overall cognitive function. However, a significant barrier to its long-term implementation is that older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) do not continue to use it or even show a dropoff in usage after the initial engagement. Such short-term engagement may limit the potential benefits of DCT, as sustained use is required to achieve more pronounced cognitive improvements. Exploring the reasons for the shift in discontinuous usage behavior is crucial for promoting successful DCT implementation and maximizing its positive effects. Objective: This study aimed to explore the intrinsic reasons for the transition from initial acceptance to discontinuous usage behavior among older adults with MCI throughout the DCT process, by employing the extended model of IT continuance (ECM-ITC). Methods: We employed a qualitative research methodology and conducted 38 semistructured interviews before and after the use of DCT (3 times per week over 1 month, with each session lasting 30 minutes) with 19 older adults with MCI (aged 60 years or older) and 4 family members between January and March 2024. Thematic analysis and deductive framework analysis were used to identify the reasons for the discontinuous usage of DCT, with mapping to the ECM-ITC. Results: Most participants failed to complete the standard dosage of DCT. Data analysis revealed the reasons for the shift to discontinuous usage. Despite their need to improve cognitive function, participants found the cognitive training confusing and discovered that DCT did not align with their preferred method of training upon actual use. The disparity between their vague expectations and reality, combined with the contradiction between the “delayed gratification” of DCT and their desire for “immediate gratification,” made it difficult for them to discern the usefulness of DCT. Participants also viewed DCT as an additional financial burden and tended to avoid training under family pressure. They relied on motivational measures, which further weakened their intention to continue DCT, ultimately leading to the inability to develop continuous usage behavior. Conclusions: Continuous usage behavior differs from initial acceptance as it evolves dynamically with user experience over time. To encourage older adults with MCI to persistently engage with DCT, it is essential to not only thoroughly consider their genuine preferences and the potential disruptions DCT may bring to their lives but also bridge the gap between expectations and actual experiences. While ensuring that older adults receive appropriate external incentives and encouragement, it is equally important to foster their intrinsic motivation, thereby gradually cultivating the habit of sustained DCT usage.

# **Abstract**
**Importance**: Spousal involvement in diabetes care is recommended theoretically, but effectiveness in clinical settings and among diverse populations is unclear.

**Objective**: To test the effect of a couple-based intervention among Chinese older patients with type 2 diabetes and their spouses.

**Design, setting, and participants**: This multicenter randomized clinical trial comprised 2 arms: a couple-based intervention arm and an individual-based control. The trial was conducted across 14 community health care centers in Guangzhou, China, between September 1, 2020, and June 30, 2022, and included patients with confirmed type 2 diabetes aged 55 years or older. Eligible partners were married to or cohabitated with the patients. Patients who previously participated in type 2 diabetes education courses were excluded, as were couples who both had diabetes, to make a clear distinction between patients and spouses. The data were analyzed between January 2023 and April 2024.

**Interventions**: The interventions consisted of 4 weekly group education sessions followed by behavior change booster telephone calls over 2 months that targeted either patients and spouses (ie, intervention arm) or patients alone (ie, control arm). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months post intervention.

**Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels for patients and quality of life for their spouses. Collective efficacy and behaviors were secondary outcomes for both patients and spouses. Group comparisons were conducted using multilevel models based on an intention-to-treat approach, with outcome measures assessed for both patients and their spouses.

**Results**: A total of 207 couples were included in the study, with 106 randomized to the intervention arm and 101 to the control arm. The mean (SD) age of patients was 66.0 (6.5) years, with 105 (50.7%) being men; spouses had similar demographics. Patients' HbA1c levels decreased in both arms over the 12-month follow-up, with no significant between-arm differences (β = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.57 to 0.42). Collective efficacy and collective behavior for patients increased after intervention but with a similar magnitude between arms. None of these measures showed between-arm differences among spouses in either arm. In subgroup analysis, decreases in HbA1c levels were constant and lasting in patients with high baseline HbA1c levels (≥8.0%) with a statistically significant difference.

**Conclusions and relevance**: These findings show that the overall treatment effect of the couple-based intervention was weak. However, the couple-based intervention benefited patients with poor glucose control. Patients' glucose levels, spouses' availability to provide support, and couples' collaborative preferences for mutual or individual diabetes management should be considered in tailoring treatment strategies among older adults with type 2 diabetes.
