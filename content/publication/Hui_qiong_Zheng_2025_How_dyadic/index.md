# **Abstract**
To explore the moderating role of dyadic appraisal in the association between dyadic coping and diabetes management efficacy. Two hundred seventy six middle-aged and older couple pairs with one spouse who had diabetes were recruited from 14 community healthcare centers across Guangzhou. The moderating role of dyadic appraisal was investigated using the actor–partner interdependence moderation model. When both couples considered diabetes to be a shared condition, statistically-significant associations were found between patients’ negative (*β* = −22.7, *p* = 0.008) and neutral behaviors (*β* = 13.6, *p* = 0.017), plus spouses’ positive behaviors (*β* = 22.8, *p* = 0.009) on their own diabetes management efficacy, respectively (i.e. actor effects); as well as between spouses’ positive (*β* = 16.8, *p* = 0.028), negative (*β* = −28.5, *p*  <  0.001), and neutral behaviors (*β* = 16.9, *p* = 0.006) on patient’s diabetes management efficacy (i.e. partner effects). Dyadic appraisal moderates the association between dyadic coping and diabetes management efficacy.
