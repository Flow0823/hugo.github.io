# **Abstract**
**Aim:** To quantify variations in health-related behaviors (HRB) clustering of older adults in Western and Eastern countries.

**Methods:** Using six aging cohorts from the USA, England, Europe, Japan, Korea and China, latent class analysis was applied to access the clustering of smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and social activity.

**Results:** A total of 104 552 participants (55% women) aged ≥50 years in 2010 were included. Despite a different number of clusters identified, three consistent cluster profiles emerged: "Multiple-HRB" (ex-/never smoking, moderate drinking, frequent physical and social activity); "Inactives" (socially and physically inactive without other risk behaviors); and "(ex-)Smokers with Risk Behaviors". Sex and cohort variations were shown. For men in Western cohorts, "Multiple-HRB" was the predominant cluster, whereas their Asian counterparts were more likely to be members of the "Smokers with risk behavior" and "Inactives" clusters. Most women, particularly those in Asian cohorts, were never smokers and non-drinkers, and most of them belonged to the socially "Inactives" cluster.

**Conclusions:** We provide a person-centered understanding of HRB clustering of older adults over selected countries by sex, informing tailored health promotion for the target population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 930-937.
