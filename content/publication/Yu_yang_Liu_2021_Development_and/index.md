# **Abstract**
**Background:** To mobilize family's positive involvement in improving and sustaining self-management activities of older adults with diabetes, we developed a couple-based collaborative management model (CCMM) for community-dwelling older Chinese. **Methods:** The model was developed stepwise through applying theoretical models, interviewing older couples and community healthcare workers, as well as incorporating expert reviews. A 3-month pilot study was conducted to test the model's feasibility and its treatment effects by linear regression on 18 pairs of older couples aged 60 years+, who were equally divided into a couple-based intervention arm and a patient-only control arm. **Results:** The developed CCMM covered four theory-driven intervention modules: dyadic assessment, dyadic education, dyadic behavior-change training, and dyadic monitoring. Each module was delivered by community healthcare workers and targeted at older couples as the management units. Based on interviews with older couples and healthcare workers, 4 weekly education and training group sessions and 2-month weekly behavior change booster calls were designed to address older adults' main management barriers. These modules and session contents were evaluated as essential and relevant by the expert panel. Furthermore, the CCMM showed good feasibility and acceptability in the pilot, with non-significant yet more positive changes in physiological outcomes of diabetic participants and couples' well-being and exercise levels of these in the intervention arm than their controlled counterparts. **Conclusion:** We systematically developed a couple-based collaborative management model of diabetes, which was well-received by healthcare practitioners and highly feasible among older Chinese couples living in the community. The model's treatment effects need to be verified in fully powered randomized controlled trials. **Clinical Trial Registration:** http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=42964, identifier: ChiCTR1900027137.
